# [yihwan.kim](http://yihwan.kim) redesign (in progress)

### To Do's
* Clean-up typography/colors constants. Increase mobile font size.
* Consider max dimensions on large high-res screens.
* Refactor command line logic into separate class.
* Add commands for dark/light mode.
* Add crappy design mode.
* Add commands for terminal zoom-in/zoom-out.
* Add command to pause/stop/restart intro snippets.
* Add more snippets as I think of them.
* Figure out if scrolling to bottom after each input/output is worth it.
* Maybe add up/down arrow support.
* Add blog / 'read' mode.
